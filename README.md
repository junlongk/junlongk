# Hello!

I am Jun Long from sunny island Singapore! :grin:


>>> I love the idea of open-source and aspire to one day, be able to create software that is used by many and greatly benefit others.

>>> I enjoy playing around with my Raspberry Pi by self-hosting my own softwares such as Pi-hole, Nextcloud etc. Am always on a look-out for other amazing self-hosted solutions!
