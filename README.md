# Hello!

I am Jun Long from the sunny island, Singapore! :grin:
I did a career switch and am now currently a trainee in software development.

I came from an academic background of aerospace, had industrial experience from the marine industry and project management experience from the industry of industrial equipments.

Technologies that I am familiar:

- Javascript: React, Next.js, Angular, Node.js
- Java: Spring Boot
- Databases: MySQL, MongoDB, Redis

More about me:
- I love the idea of open-source and aspire to one day, be able to create software that is used by many and greatly benefit others.
- I enjoy messing around with my Raspberry Pi by self-hosting my own softwares such as Pi-hole, Nextcloud etc. Am always on a look-out for other amazing self-hosted solutions!
